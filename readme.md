## Infrastructure as a code (IaC)

IaC allows us to create and manage cloud resources such as virutal private networks, storages, etc using a code/script. It enables automation and versioning of the procedures used to maintain an infrastructure. Using IaC we can easily reproduce an environment e.g. a staging or production in a greater speed.

This project demonstrates the implementaion of IaC using Terraorm on Google Cloud Platform.
